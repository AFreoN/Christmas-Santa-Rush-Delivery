# Christmas-Santa-Rush-Delivery
Developed a lively mobile game where players, in the role of Santa, navigate through AI-controlled realistic traffic to deliver gifts. The game features realistic car controls and a mini map for route strategizing, adding a layer of complexity and thrill. This project showcases my skills in game development, AI integration, and user interface design.
